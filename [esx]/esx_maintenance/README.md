# ESX Maintenance

This is your own personal bouncer for your server... When you're working on your server and you want to keep people outside for a while, this is the script for you.

# Easy Maintenance Configuration

Just go to the config file and set true or false whenever you want to be on Maintenance mode or not...

# Whitelisting System Built-in

Allows you to handpick only a few, who will help you while on maintenance mode, if you whitelist them through the config file...
